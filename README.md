# 7-Crypto: A Secure and Fast Crypto Library

7-Crypto is a new crypto library with securely implemented crypto algorithms and protocols. 

The design of 7-Crypto follows the principle of Occam's Razor --- "entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily".
It only contains meticuluously developed and checked code.

7-Crypto runs fast on many platforms such as x64 and ARM.
